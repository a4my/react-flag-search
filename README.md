# Flag search 💥

This repo is another one of my React projects. It displays a list of all countries coming from an API and it is rendered using React. 

You can also sort the list by continents or number of countries to display using range and radio inputs. This is made possible by using React's useState & useEffect.

## What I used 🔨
My goal with this project was to build my own project from scratch to practice HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, APIs and React. 

## Extra learning ✔
Throughout the development of this project I had to research information about the version 6 of React since my code kept on breaking because most of what I learnt about React was from React version 5. So things like activeStyle, activeClassName, Switch, component and exact props were obsolete. This actually gave me another glimpse of what a day in the life of a web developer looks like 😎  

## Responsiveness ❕
This project has not been made responsive on smartphones for now.
